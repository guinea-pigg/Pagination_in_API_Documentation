# Pagination Concept in API Documentation

## Preface

Welcome to the <em>Pagination Concept in API Documentation</em> project. The repository contains the final project for Vistula post-graduate studies on Technical Communication. At the same time the repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of pagination within the context of API documentation. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who can benefit from the project?

Whether you're a junior technical writer or someone eager to deepen your knowledge about API and API documentation without prior expertize, this project is designed with you in mind.

### What is the purpose of the project?

API documentation is essential for developers and technical writers to understand how to interact with an API effectively. Pagination is a crucial concept within API documentation, especially when dealing with large datasets. To understand the concept of pagination in API it is also needed to have general knowledge of API in general. Understanding pagination ensures that developers and technical writers can navigate through data efficiently, enhancing the usability and performance of their applications.

Having that in mind, the project aims to:
- Give general overview what API is
- Describe the basics of pagination in API and in API documentation
- Acquaint the junior technical writers with good practises regarding API documentation.
