# Pagination in API Documentation. Introduction

## Definition of Pagination

Pagination in API documentation refers to the practice of breaking large sets of data into smaller, more manageable pieces called <em>pages</em>. These pages allow users to retrieve data progressively instead of all at once. Each page typically contains a subset of the total dataset, enabling efficient data retrieval and reducing the strain on both the client and server.

## Why Pagination is Important in API Documentation
- **Scalability:** APIs often deal with massive datasets. Pagination enables efficient handling of such data by dividing it into smaller, more manageable portions.
- **Performance:** Retrieving large datasets in a single request can lead to slow response times and increased server load. Pagination mitigates this issue by distributing data retrieval across multiple requests.
- **Reduced bandwidth consumption:** By fetching only the necessary data, pagination minimizes bandwidth usage, resulting in faster response times and reduced network overhead.
- **Improved user experience:** Users interacting with APIs, such as developers building applications, benefit from paginated responses as they can access relevant data step by step, improving the overall user experience.
