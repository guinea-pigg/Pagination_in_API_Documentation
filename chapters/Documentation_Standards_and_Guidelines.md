# API Documentation Standards and Guidelines

Pagination is a crucial aspect of API documentation, and documenting it effectively is essential for users to understand how to retrieve and navigate through paginated data. Standards and guidelines for documenting pagination in API reference documentation cover areas such as:
   - [documenting pagination in API reference](#Documenting-Pagination-in-API-reference),
   - [writing clear pagination instructions](#Writing-Clear-Pagination-Instructions),
   - [providing usage examples](#Providing-Usage-Examples).

It is worth noting that numerous API documentations have general introductions with limited space for the pagination concept. Pagination is usually just a small part of the overall API documentation introduction. In case of API that handles small loads of data, pagination is frequently not applied.

## Documenting Pagination in API Reference

### 1. Introduction to Pagination 

Documentation has to provide an overview of pagination and its importance in retrieving large datasets efficiently.

A chapter on pagination in API is available at the [X Developer Platform](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination). The chapter, titled *Pagination*, includes:
- use cases for pagination,
- pagination token definitions,
- fundamentals of pagination,
- pagination examples.

The chapter covers all aspects of managing pagination for developers using X's API, beginning from short explanation what pagination is: 

*Pagination is a feature in X API v2 endpoints that return more results than can be returned in a single response. When that happens, the data is returned in a series of 'pages'. Pagination refers to methods for programatically requesting all of the pages, in order to retrieve the entire result data set.*

### 2. Pagination Parameters

Documentation should describe the pagination parameters supported by the API. Depending on a type of pagination, it can include:
   - `page`: specifying the page number to retrieve,
   - `limit`: specifying the maximum number of items per page,
   - additionally: any other parameters specific to the pagination style used, such as cursor values or keyset identifiers.

An example showing this practice is documentation at the [X Developer Platform](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination). It lists different parameters that facilitate the use of pagination in the documentation, such as: `next_token`, `previous_token`, `max_results`, `pagination_token`.

### 3. Request Structure

Documentation should clearly outline the structure of the API request when paginating data. It can include elements such as:
   - parameters for specifying the page number or cursor,
   - the number of records to be returned per page (page size),
   - any additional filters or sorting options that can be applied to the request.

Documentation at the [X Developer Platform](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination) shows an exemplary request and the sequence of further requests that retrieves the next pages of data. 

The initial request specifies a user ID (`2244994945`) and the time period for obtaining the results, from January 1, 2019, at 17:00:00 UTC to December 12, 2019, at 00:00:00 UTC.

`https://api.twitter.com/2/users/2244994945/tweets?tweet.fields=created_at&max_results=100&start_time=2019-01-01T17:00:00Z&end_time=2020-12-12T01:00:00Z`

Because the API parameter `max_results` is set to 100 and there are approximately 295 posts created by user ID `2244994945`, the results are spread across three pages. To get the second page of results, the request needs the following parameters:

- `max_results=100`
- `tweet.fields=created_at`
- `start_time=2019-01-01T17:00:00Z`
- `end_time=2020-12-12T01:00:00Z`
- `pagination_token=7140w`

Documentation highlights that in order "to get the next page, take the `next_token value` directly from the response (`7140w`) and set it as the `pagination_token` for the next request call.

### 4. Response Structure

Documentation should describe the structure of the API response when paginating data. It can include elements such as:
   - total number of records available,
   - links or cursors for navigating to the next or previous pages,
   - representation of the current page of data.

### 5. Error Handling

Documentation should list any potential errors or edge cases related to pagination, such as invalid pagination parameters or reaching the end of the dataset. It should also provide clear explanations and recommended actions for users to address these issues.

<a id="Writing-Clear-Pagination-Instructions"></a>
## Writing Clear Pagination Instructions

### 1. Define Usage Patterns

Documentation should explain how users should format API requests to paginate data effectively. It should provide examples of valid pagination requests using the supported parameters.

[Example from Stripe API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination):

### 2. Clarify Default Behavior

If the API has default pagination settings or behaviors, documentation should explain them explicitly. Users should understand what happens if they don't specify pagination parameters in their requests.

[Example from Mailchimp API]():LINK !!

### 3. Address Edge Cases

The documentation should anticipate common questions or confusion points related to pagination, such as navigating to specific pages or handling large datasets. Provide detailed instructions or troubleshooting tips to address these scenarios.

[Example from Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using):

`To navigate to a specific page, include the startIndex parameter in your request. If the specified index exceeds the total number of items, the API will return an empty list.`

<a id="Providing-Usage-Examples"></a>
## Providing Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Examples

The documentation should include simple, straightforward examples demonstrating how to paginate through data using the API. It should show how to retrieve the first page, navigate to the next page, and adjust pagination parameters.

[Twitter](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination)

### 2. Advanced Examples

The documentation should show more complex examples that showcase different pagination scenarios, such as sorting, filtering, or combining pagination with other query parameters.

[YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/pagination?hl=en)

### 3. Sample Code Snippets

The documentation should show code snippets in various programming languages illustrating how to integrate pagination into API requests. It should also include comments to explain each step and highlight key pagination parameters.
