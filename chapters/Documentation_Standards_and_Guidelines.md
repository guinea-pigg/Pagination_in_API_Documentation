# Documentation Standards and Guidelines

Pagination is a crucial aspect of API documentation, and documenting it effectively is essential for users to understand how to retrieve and navigate through paginated data. Standards and guidelines for documenting pagination in API reference documentation cover areas such as:
   - [documenting pagination in API reference](#Documenting-Pagination-in-API-reference),
   - [writing clear pagination instructions](#Writing-Clear-Pagination-Instructions),
   - [providing usage examples](#Providing-Usage-Examples).

## Documenting Pagination in API Reference

1. **Introduction to Pagination:** Documentation should provide an overview of pagination and its importance in retrieving large datasets efficiently. It should also explain why pagination is necessary and how it enhances the usability of the API.

2. **Pagination Parameters:** Documentation should describe the pagination parameters supported by the API, including:
   - `page`: specifying the page number to retrieve.
   - `limit`: specifying the maximum number of items per page.
   - additionally: any other parameters specific to the pagination style used, such as cursor values or keyset identifiers.

3. **Response Structure:** Documentation should describe the structure of the API response when paginating data, including:
   - total number of records available,
   - links or cursors for navigating to the next or previous pages,
   - representation of the current page of data.

4. **Error Handling:** Documentation should list any potential errors or edge cases related to pagination, such as invalid pagination parameters or reaching the end of the dataset. It should also provide clear explanations and recommended actions for users to address these issues.

## Writing Clear Pagination Instructions

1. **Define Usage Patterns:** Documentation should explain how users should format API requests to paginate data effectively. It should provide examples of valid pagination requests using the supported parameters.

2. **Clarify Default Behavior:** If the API has default pagination settings or behaviors, documentation should explain them explicitly. Users should understand what happens if they don't specify pagination parameters in their requests.

3. **Address Edge Cases:** The documentation should anticipate common questions or confusion points related to pagination, such as navigating to specific pages or handling large datasets. Provide detailed instructions or troubleshooting tips to address these scenarios.

<a id="Providing-Usage-Examples"></a>
## Providing Usage Examples

1. **Basic Examples:** The documentation should include simple, straightforward examples demonstrating how to paginate through data using the API. It should show how to retrieve the first page, navigate to the next page, and adjust pagination parameters.

2. **Advanced Examples:** The documentation should show more complex examples that showcase different pagination scenarios, such as sorting, filtering, or combining pagination with other query parameters.

3. **Sample Code Snippets:** The documentation should show code snippets in various programming languages illustrating how to integrate pagination into API requests. It should also include comments to explain each step and highlight key pagination parameters.
