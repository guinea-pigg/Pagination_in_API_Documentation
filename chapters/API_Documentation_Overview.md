# API Documentation. Overview

## Short explanation on API documentation

To understand the concept of API pagination, let's begin with a short overview what API and API documentation are. 

{: .highlight }
An API is a set of tools or functions that allow different software systems to communicate and interact with each other. It can be compared to a bridge that enables one piece of software to access the features or data of another.

**API documentation is a piece of work created by a technical writer based on a given API.** It is addressed to developers who, thanks to the comprehensive and simple explanation, are able to use API effectively. 

API documentation typically includes parts such as:

1. **Overview**: A general explanation of what the API does and its purpose.
2. **Endpoints and methods**: Information about the different endpoints (URLs) available in the API and the methods (such as `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`) that can be used to interact with them.
3. **Parameters**: Details about the parameters or inputs that can be passed to each endpoint, including their data types, formats, and any restrictions.
4. **Response format**: Descriptions of the data format and structure of the responses returned by the API, including possible status codes and error messages.
5. **Authentication**: Instructions on how to authenticate and authorize requests to the API, if required.
6. **Examples and use cases**: Practical examples and use cases to illustrate how to use the API in real-world scenarios.
7. **Code samples**: Sample code snippets in various programming languages to demonstrate how to make requests to the API.
8. **Best practices**: Recommendations and guidelines for using the API efficiently and securely.
