# 3. Implementing Pagination in API Documentation

Pagination that is implemented in the optimal way serves the overarching goal: enabling users to navigate through data easily and effectively. At the same time, the proper manner of pagination implementation aims to avoid consuming excessive resources or overwhelming the server.

The first pillar that constitutes the correct implementation of pagination in API documents is a proper design of API endpoints for pagination. The second pillar is to implement pagination in different programming languages, such as Python, Java and JavaScript.

**API Endpoint Design for Pagination:**

When designing API endpoints for pagination, it's essential to consider the following aspects:

1. **Resource Endpoint:** Define clear and consistent resource endpoints for accessing paginated data. For example, `/users` might be the endpoint for retrieving a list of users.

2. **Query Parameters:** Use query parameters to enable pagination. Common parameters include:
   - `page` or `offset`: Indicates the page number or the number of records to skip.
   - `limit`: Specifies the maximum number of records to return per page.
   - Additional parameters such as `sort` or `filter` can enhance usability and flexibility.

3. **Response Structure:** Define a clear structure for the API response, indicating the current page number, total number of records, and links to navigate to the next or previous pages. Consider using standardized formats like JSON API or HAL for consistency and ease of understanding.

4. **Error Handling:** Provide appropriate error messages and status codes for scenarios like invalid pagination parameters or reaching the end of the dataset.

GET /users?page=1&limit=10

This request would retrieve the first page of users with a limit of 10 users per page.
